## Character creation

### Races

#### Human 
While possibly being of hardier stock, this character is nonetheless like you or me.

#### Elf 
Patterned after the Tolkien elf, the elf is slight of build, frequently taller than a human, and
very inclined to magic.

#### Dwarf 
The Dwarven people are short and stout, extremely strong and healthy, but not amazingly
intelligent.

#### Hobbit 
Hobbits (Halflings) are slightly smaller than Dwarves but are nimble and dexterous. 

#### Half-Elf
These cross breeds are usually blond and fair-skinned, like elves, and gel some added
size and strength from their human ancestry.

#### Gnome
Gnomes closely resemble dwarves, but have less hair and even shorter tempers. They are
also more magically inclined, as a rule.


## Classes

#### Fighter

Fighters can use any weapons or armor.  They gain an extra attack every 3 levels.

#### Cleric

Holy crusaders eschew edged and ranged weapons, preferring blunted maces, staffs or hammers.
They can wear any armor and gain an extra attack every 4 levels.
Clerics seek out holy places to learn wisdom giving them holy powers of healing
and powers against the undead.

#### Thief

This highly versatile profession can be proficient with any weapons but is limited to
lighter armor since they need their dexterity for shoplifting, pick pocketing, looting, infiltration
and unlocking/disarming treasure chests. They gain an extra attack every 4 levels.

#### Mage

Acolytes of the mystic arts are limited to one handed swords, daggers, staffs and slings and can't
usually wear most armor since they need dexterity for their spell casting.
While they only gain an extra attack every 5 levels, they compensate with magic spells.


### Character Statistics

#### Hit points
Measures the damage a character can take before they are down.

#### Mana points
Represents the current mental power of the character for spell casting and using skills.

#### Level

The general level of your character. Higher is better.  When you gain a level you also
gain more hit points and mana points.

#### Armor class
Protection based on armor, shields, clothing and magic.

#### Experience points

Experience earned from quests, exploration and fighting monsters. These points can be 
spent on gaining levels and learning new skills/abilities.

#### Encumbrance/Max Carryable

Items and coinage have weight in the game. The more stuff you lugs around the more
encumbered you will be. Encumbered characters are slowed down in combat.

### Character Attributes

Each character you create has six primary attributes which define their abilities.
When you create a character each attribute is randomly assigned a value up to 100 which
is equivalent to the maximum human value.

#### Strength

Strength is physical power and chiefly affects the amount of damage a character can do to an
opponent in hand-to-hand combat. Make sure your fighting characters are strong.

#### Agility

Measures general dexterity & nimbleness. A high score makes your characters harder to hit,
and helps them strike the first blow in combat. Magic spells and trap disarming require
good a agility score. 

#### Intelligence

Intelligence is mental power. A high intelligence rating will enable your 
Magic users to gain more mana for their spells.

#### Wisdom
Wisdom is the character’s enlightenment, judgement, wile, will power  
and intuitiveness. A high wisdom enables your clerics to gain more mana.    

#### Constitution

Constitution is the character's overall health affecting hit points gained per level and 
their resistance to various substances and magical attacks.

#### Charisma

Charisma affects how non player characters might interact with you.
