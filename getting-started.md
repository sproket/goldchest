# Getting started


Spells work like Bards Tale use the CAST menu and type one of the codes in.
Some can be cast outside combat like heal and strength, the others are combat only.

For races there are adjustments to the rolling attributes. Check in your home folder\goldchest\races.csv file. Race may have other effects later on.

To rest, go to an Inn. REST menu will rest characters and restore mana and hp.

Classes are chosen by going to one of the guilds and using the LEVEL menu. You can mix classes in any combination.

Thief guild is at 4,4, Fighter guild is at 13,3, Mage guild is at 13,15, Temple is at 6,12. (I use ROW,COL) I think originally it was COL,ROW which I can fix later.

To get the coordinate of where you are to appear, have someone train for Basic Cartography.

To get the compass to appear buy one at the General Store.

Yeah at first you have to move around kind of blindly in the town to find things. :)
